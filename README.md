# Flight-Reservation-System
This project was made as a part of college course in Java. 
Here you can search for flights to Singapore from cities like Delhi , Mumbai and Pune where direct flights are not available.
Spicejet airlines are partnering with silkair airlines.
SpiceJet will provide the connection from these north-western cities to Bangalore, Chennai, Hyderabad and Kolkata, where SilkAir currently operates flights to Singapore.

Travel will take place between October 1, 2016 and November13, 2016. 
Each flight has 15 seats. Passengers can book for a maximum of 10 seats. Booking requires just one name. 

For running this project:

1. Open the terminal
2. Go to the directory
3. Type "java -jar FRS.jar spicejet.csv silkair.csv" without quotes.
